# T9 Dictionary

T9 Dictionary is a program created as part of the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at Jagiellonian University. The project implements the functionality of word search using the T9 dictionary, a popular method of text input on mobile devices with a numeric keyboard. This implementation supports the English language.

## Data Structure
A prefix tree data structure, also known as a trie, is utilized to store the dictionary and expedite the process of word search.

## Requirements
- Python
- Tkinter library (for the graphical interface)

## Running the Program
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nazar-kuziv/T9-Dictionary.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the Tkinter library if you haven't already, using the command:
   ```
   pip install tk
   ```
4. Run the program through an IDE.

## Usage
1. Use the up and down arrow keys on the numeric keyboard to search for the desired expression among the suggestions.
2. Use the "Shift" key on the numeric keyboard to enter capital letters.
3. Press "#" to erase the previously entered character.
4. Double-tap "0" for a space.
5. Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate through the typed text.
